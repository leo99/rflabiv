Therefore, a capacitor
will provide its lowest impedance path required for
optimal coupling and bypass functionality at its series
resonant frequency.

In bypass applications, it is desirable to operate at the
capacitor’s FSR where the impedance is essentially equal
to the ESR and zero net reactance. For the best practical
solution, the author suggests selecting the lowest
standard EIA capacitor value that exhibits an FSR that
is slightly higher than the application bypass frequency.

Edge mounting a capacitor, i.e. electrodes
normal to the ground plane, is typically taken as the
optimal orientation, as it yields the benefit of greatly
suppressing odd order parallel resonances.

In bypass applications the flat mount scenario with
electrodes parallel to the ground plane may prove to be
more advantageous because the net inductance resulting
from this mounting orientation is lower.

The use of larger diameter via holes is preferable
in order to minimize the associated inductance.

They (multiple caps) are selected such that their self-resonant
frequencies are staggered in order to cover a wide
range of frequencies with reasonably low loss. The number
of required capacitive elements depends on the loss
and impedance characteristics of each element over the
intended frequency band segments.

Capacitor elements C2, C3 and C4
are staggered in value and are selected so that the
impedance and inductive reactance of each will be low at
successive frequency segments in order to offer continuous
bypassing of frequencies below the amplifier’s operating
band.
